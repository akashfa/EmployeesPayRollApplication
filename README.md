 # EmployeesPayRollApplication
building an Employee Payroll Management System in Core Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles involves organizing the code around objects and classes. Here's an explanation focusing on OOP concepts:

Class Design:

Employee Class: This class represents an employee and encapsulates their attributes and behaviors.
Payroll Class: Responsible for payroll-related calculations, deductions, bonuses, etc.
Main Class: Contains the main method to run the program.
Encapsulation:

Encapsulation means bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, i.e., a class. For instance, the Employee class encapsulates attributes like name, ID, salary, etc., and methods to manipulate this data.
Inheritance:

You might create subclasses that inherit attributes and methods from a base Employee class. For example, you could have classes like FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee that inherit from the Employee class.
Polymorphism:

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. For example, a method that processes employee salaries can accept objects of different employee types (FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee) due to their common base class (Employee).
Abstraction:

Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. Methods like calculateSalary() within the Employee class can abstract the complex salary calculation logic.
